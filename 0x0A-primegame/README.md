## They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.

* Prototype: `def isWinner(x, nums)`
* where `x` is the number of rounds and `nums` is an array of `n`
* Return: name of the player that won the most rounds
* If the winner cannot be determined, return `None`
* You can assume n and x will not be larger than 10000
* You cannot import any packages in this task

# Example:

* `x = 3, nums = [4, 5, 1]`
